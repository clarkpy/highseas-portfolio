    startDate: "18th November 2024",
    details: "Taskify is a straightforward task management system to help users organize their activities. It has a clean interface that allows for task creation, editing, and deletion. The project was an opportunity to get better at vanilla JavaScript and experiment with CSS techniques for creating layouts.",
    challenges: "One of the challenges was implementing a drag-and-drop feature for reordering tasks without relying on external libraries. This pushed me to use the HTML5 Drag and Drop API and improve some of my skills.",
    learnings: "Through this project, I gained an understanding of DOM manipulation and local storage for data. It also helped me appreciate the value of thorough planning before diving in.",
    futureImprovements: "Future improvements could include adding some sort of  to save tasks across devices and implementing a notification system for reminders."
